# Build application

To build the application go into the application folder. In this folder create a build folder. Go into this folder and execute the following commands:

> cmake ..

> make -j<n_of_cores>

The following paths need to be in the path

* C:\Qt\Tools\CMake_64\bin
* C:\Qt\Tools\mingw810_64\bin
